## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of C programs that can determine different types of numbers. Each program is designed to be simple and educational, making it easy to understand the logic behind each type of number.

## 🔢 Number Types

Here are the types of numbers you will find in this repository:

- `Abundant Number`: A number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
- `Adam Number`: A number that is a multiple of 12 and has exactly 12 divisors.
- `Admirable Number`: A number for which the sum of its proper divisors is less than the number itself.
- `Armstrong Number`: A number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
- `Betrothal Number`: A pair of numbers where the sum of the proper divisors of one number is one more than the other number.
- `Deficient Number`: A number for which the sum of its proper divisors is less than the number itself.
- `Factorial Number`: A number that is the factorial of an integer.
- `Fascinating Number`: A number that, when multiplied by 2 and 3, and the results concatenated with the original number, contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- `Magic Number`: A number for which the sum of its digits repeatedly adds up to 1.
- `Perfect Number`: A number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).
- `Prime Number`: A number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- `Spy Number`: A number where the sum of its digits equals the product of its digits.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with these programs, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. If you don't have one, you can download GCC from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
